# SmartCallout â€“ BBCode for Woltlab WCF2.1

>Licence: http://www.cls-design.com/index.php/LicenceFree/

With the SmartCallout BBCode everyone can easily highlight certain passages within his/her text. By highlighting passages, the author can indicate either certain things or compile again briefly and concisely all the important information.

The SmartCallout BBCode is structured the way that one needs at least one color (hexCode). By using the color, you can assign a color to the border on the left or right hand side and thus, you'll receive a slightly wider border on the left or right hand side. So a marked passage attracts attention and can not be overlooked. By default, the border is on the left hand side.

There's also the option to say that you want to have a title for the callout. You can do this simply by means of an attribute in the BBCode, namely adding the title. Then the title is always automatically displayed in the color of the border, which itself highlights the callout again.

#### Overview of the functions

* Create Callout [scallout=hexCode] Text [/scallout]
* Include title [scallout=hexCode,Titel] Text [/scallout]
* Determine border position [scallout=hexCode,Titel,right] or [scallout=hexCode,right] = if there's no title
